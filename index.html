But also, I do think a lot of it is distractions and just your mind acting up and I know how close you get, attached and I saw a lot of myself in you so maybe I was trying to protect you as well.

I know you don't really feel it I guess but it hurts knowing that I can't help or be there. I can't say it for others because I know you have people close and I know how you have many people who care especially now. But I still want to be there when I can be. If I can lend you a hand or just even temporarily make you smile while you're going through something then it is better than nothing and it actually makes me happy. You take on too much pressure, sadness and emotions all on your shoulders. Letting someone help you even for a second isn't a sign of weakness, it is you growing up. When you were growing up and learning to walk, did you not use a walker? Did aunty and uncle not hold your hand? It is that Radha. Let people, let us, let me, help you and be there for when you need it. We all face tough times, it makes us human.

The "something is better than nothing" line hurts. It really does. Not because it is a painful experience (it is) but also because I have been there. Maybe I still am. I was talking about this with someone the other day and I said that sometimes when you love someone the most, you almost want them to find someone first. You know that you physically can't. You know that while they are single, deep down you're going to want to look for a chance to be with them. You do this a lot. I have before as well. It is a new year so let's try not to do this anymore. Radha's feelings. Radha's emotions. Radha's health. Radha's everything comes first. No one else. Nothing else. I know you can't help not be attached. I know. I can't either. That's why I hurt so much. That's why I hate it so much. But let's try it. Even if we like someone, we need to try and do something more. Let's not sit there idly. Let's not let them have their way around it. It is you. It has always been you Radha. From the start. No one else. Don't forget that.`

Look at the people you are talking to right now. Look at the love you are getting from them. Yes, we all want our crush's love, we all want that love — but this love isn't bad either. The love from these people: friends, family, whatever. And when it comes to friends and life — Radha, you know how scared I am of losing people. You know how much I couldn't lose you even during your whole off time — but you will find a way if it is needed. You will find a way to be loved. You will find a way to be okay. You will keep the friends you want to if they want to. You will lose a few. But guess what — you will be okay because you have more than enough amazing loving people, and the ones who have gone are just part of God's plan :)`

But deep down, I did wish that you and him could have at least had a whole thing so you could be satisfied cos you know Radha's happiness on top. But you know those memories stay with you still. The thoughts, the feelings, the moments- the video calls and tiktok password, snapchat password. Don't forget those things even if you want to. They were all learning experiences. They were all things that defined you. I know it ended as a bad chapter but it isn't over over Radha. You know why? Cos you are still here, with more than enough that love and care about you.`

We think too much. We love too much. We care too much. What the fuck can we do. You tell me Radha. How the fuck can I change myself. How do you stop loving so much and so hard. How do you end up trying to control yourself and just being okay? I don't think I can so it just really annoys me. I wish I had more control in that aspect. I just wish I was okay in that way. I mean I will say it as it is but I am attached to people right now even. Maybe if we even take you as an instance, if you're not okay, it will be running through my mind. I will think and think and just yeah. Maybe that's just me. But I don't know if I recommend you doing it cos care just hurts a lot. At the end of the day it really fucking hurts. Even if we say a thousand times that we don't care and it doesn't bother us, it does. I know it does. We just have to act like we don't give a fuck. That's what we are. Just fakers I guess.`

The day I stopped this habit was the day your car broke down and you called me. And I remember the words "you're never there when I need you." And it really made an impact-ish. Not because just anyway. But I actually felt needed. Like someone actually remembered me. Someone remembered me while they were in a crisis. The least I could do is be free. From that day onwards, I mean I don't know if you noticed it or not but I started being free on my phone. I also got a lot of notifications. So I changed my DND to a social media where only my social media notifs would come through: WhatsApp, Snapchat and Instagram. When a Snapchat notif came through with a sound, I would take a look to see if it was Radha or not. Maybe it wasn't obvious obvious but I made those lil changes. I wasn't gonna be relied on by someone and let them down. Not again. Probably why we got even closer to be honest.`
